Credits
-----------------
@Typical0 for bringing the idea to life, making HRH27, android-3.0_r1 and IFL10 (with addition of IRK36B and IRK40C for Nexus S and ITL28B for Galaxy Nexus).
@main3782 for extensive work on many builds (including almost all Honeycomb, the entirety of Ice Cream Sandwich, Cupcake, AAQ65 for Key Lime Pie and so on).
@Dobby233Liu for resolving a ton of build conflicts and creating Froyocomb Helper.

@pivotman319-owo for their findings about ```base-for-3.x-gpl.xml```, which made us realize it is possible to reconstruct different builds in a way like that.
@FrostCoreAlt for their work on Android Donut builds.
